Over the past years I've started spending more time on following online courses. Even though there's a lot you can learn from specs, documents and blogposts, following a topic in a structured way can be really helpful in fully understanding a topic. For this series I'll do a write-up / review on some of the courses I've followed, starting out with *ES6 for everyone* by Wes Bos. 

## Introduction
ES6 for everyone is a course focussed on, you guessed it, ES6 (Although, the naming of JavaScript standards is actually wildly confusing). The course is aimed at getting you to know all the usefull new options in JavaScript and how you can apply them at whatever you're working on every day. Besides teaching you loads of new stuff, it's also aimed at developing your general JavaScript skills. 

### Who's Wes?
To be honest, I didn't do a great amount of research on Wes before I bought the course. I think there was a sale on the master package, and all the reviews I read were good so I went for it. Luckily it turns Wes knows his stuff. If you've ever Googled for solutions on JavaScript problems or looked for free courses, chances are high you've ended up at [his website](http://wesbos.com/) before. He has a bunch of helpful blogposts and free video's on JavaScript like [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/), a free 30 day vanilla js code challenge. If you want to do some fun JS projects and get to know his teaching style before you invest in ES6, I highly recommend you to do them. Wes is also the host of Syntax.fm, a weekly podcast on everything webdevelopment.

### Content and pricing
The ES6 course comes in two forms: The starter course which includes 7 modules (27 streamable videos), unlimited access to updates, all the source code and access to the ES6 for Everyone Slack channel. This'll set you back $89,-. For $139,- you get the full package which includes 21 modules (77 streamable and downloadable videos) with lessons about ES6 Classes, Generators and Proxies and ES2017 Async + Await. There are also options for team licenses and student discounts. When I was traveling, I noticed that Wes also offers dicsounts based on location, so called 'Parity Purchasing Power'. This makes the courses a lot more affordable and available for a lot of people around the world, and I think it's a great thing to do. Also, I didn't take advantage, I promise. 

### Video and Audio
The quality
The videoplayer deserves a special mention because it has some great controls. Especially the control to speed-up the video without any high pitched audio distortion is a blessing. When I (re)watch videos I mostly watch them at 1.5x or 2x speed and it works great. There are also controls to skip 10 or 25s which are great to quickly rewatch something or skip a dad joke ;). If you've bought the full package you can also download all the videos directly.

## The course

The full course consists out of 21 modules and 77(!) videos ranging in length from two to 12 minutes. I'm not sure how many minutes it is in total, but I do know that Wes will teach you how to calculate this exact case with chaining a bunch of `Array methods`. There are videos on topics ranging from `const` and `let` to `async` and `await`. You'll learn about ES6 classes, generators, maps and sets, but also about tooling and linting.

## Modules and videos

The course is divided into modules, and these modules contain multiple videos on either a specific subject or a bunch of subjects that are highly related. The course does follow a bit of a path and doing the course from beginning to end feels very fulfilling. At the same time the modules allow you to choose any topic you want and dive in as well. I've re-watched some modules more than once just to get a refresher on the subject again.

Wes explains the subjects with real, or at least plausible, examples that show you where these methods will come in handy and why you should use them. There are some modules that include excercises, but there are also plenty of other times where Wes will suggest you to pause the video and see if you can come up with your own solution before seeing his. The source code is available so if you want you can poke around with all the results right away. Personally I remember what I've learned better when I write them all out myself so I tend to type along with Wes in his videos, and every now and then copy some stuff from the source files because it's too tedious to type out (Yes I'm lazy like that).

Both the duration of the video's and Wes his upbeat teaching style make that I never got bored or distracted while doing these courses. After doing like 5 modules in one sittings I noticed that I kinda start to zone out, but seriously that's a lot of information. In general I found the course really enjoyable and I've seen most videos more than twice by now.

### Updates and value
That brings be to the value of this course, which is amazing (I'm starting to sound like a carsalesman). But for real, I've bought this course in July 2016 and It's more than relevant enough to review almost a year and a half later. One reason that this course is so replayable is the way it's cut up in modules and videos, making it great reference material on specific methods you're working with. Another reason for the replay value is that it contains so much information. At the moment I'm going over the course again and I'm looking up everything that I'm not totally confident in, giving the course a third life. 

I say third life, because Wes also makes sure this course continues to have value. Every now and then he does some really great updates to the course which everyone who bought the original will get access to. Subjects like `async` and `await` and information on `es7`, `es8` and more have been added to this course, making sure it stays up to date. I don't know for how long Wes will continue to update his courses, but as I wasn't expecting such massive updates I'm happy with everything we get!
