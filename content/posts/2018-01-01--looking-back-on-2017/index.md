## Introduction

While the world appeared to be burning around us, my girlfriend and I spent 2017 floating on cloud nine. Usually you'd reflect on the year with something like "It was a year with highs and lows", but I can honestly say it has mostly been 'highs and higher highs' both litteraly and figuratively. We started our year while we were already in the midst of our Central-America trip, and ended up relocating to a new location in Europe.

### Traveling

The year started in good fashion on Caye Caulker, Belize. This Caribbean paradise was the perfect island to start a new year.

In 2016 we decided to save up for a long trip through Central America. On the 9th of november 2016, the day Trump got elected, we flew to Mexico City with the plan to travel south and fly out from Colombia six months later. Traveling like this is something we always wanted to do, and with little responsibilities in our lives, now seemed the perfect time.

The whole trip was filled with amazing experiences and we ended up extending it by a month and a half, because we weren't ready to go back yet

#### New experiences

### A new location

In the weeks before our flight back to Amsterdam, we realised we weren't really looking forward to go back to our regular lives. Amsterdam is a beautiful city to live in, but it seemed that both of us wanted to open a new chapter in our lives. Ever since the first time we've been in Lisbon, Portugal, we fell in love with the city. A good friend of us lived there and we talked about the possibility to move there before.

With all the preperations we had done for our trip, like getting rid of as much stuff as possible and wrapping up loose ends in adminstration and such, we had the perfect opportunity to follow through with a move to a new location. Even before we left Bogota for Amsterdam, we booked a flight from Amsterdam to Portugal seven days after our return.

The first two weeks in Portugal we stayed with our friend and his girlfriend. They had a studio appartment so it was basically like a big sleepover, which was great. After those two weeks, my girlfriend found us a great apartment in the center of town. It's actually one of the nicest appartments we've ever lived in, and after 7.5 months on the road it's really nice to have our own space again.

### Studying and improving

After settling, I picked up some freelance development work. I was surprised that people still knew how to find me because I've barely done any freelancing the past two and a half years. Before traveling I was working for a company and put most of my freelance work aside.

I can't say it has been very busy, but it has been sufficient and it gave me time to study and think about what I want to do next. I've been greatly focussed on enhancing my JavaScript skills and getting a deeper understanding of React. I can honestly say that I found a renewed focus on learning new material.
