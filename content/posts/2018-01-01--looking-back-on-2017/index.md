## Introduction

While the world appeared to be burning around us, my girlfriend Monika and I spent 2017 floating on cloud nine. Usually you'd reflect on the year with something like "It was a year with highs and lows", but I can honestly say it has mostly been 'highs and higher highs' both litteraly and figuratively. We started our year while we were already in the midst of our Central-America trip, and ended up relocating to a new location in Europe.

## Traveling

In 2016 we decided to save up for a long trip through Central America. We've always wanted to travel for a longer period and it seemed to be the right time. Both of us quit our jobs and the 9th of November (the day Trump got elected) we flew to Mexico City for a 6 months trip through Central America.

On the 9th of november 2016, the day Trump got elected, we flew to Mexico City with the plan to travel south and fly out from Colombia six months later. A long travel is something we always wanted to do, and seeing as I already had been in Mexico and we both have been to Colombia, a trip between the two countries seemed like a fun thing to do. 

 Traveling like this is something we always wanted to do, and with little responsibilities in our lives, now seemed the perfect time.

The whole trip was filled with amazing experiences and we ended up extending it by a month and a half, because we weren't ready to go back yet

### Some things I learned while / by traveling

#### You don't need a lot of stuff

A few years ago Monika and I threw out 80% of our stuff. Clothes, books, memoribilia, you name it. It wasn't easy but there was a huge weight lifted of our shoulders when we were done. Having few positions made it really easy to pack and leave for our travels and our backpacks didn't weigh more than 10kg. Realizing that there's so much you can do without also made it really easy to relocate.

#### Spanish

Por supuesto! We spent a month of our travels learning Spanish at the *Case Xelaju* language school in Quetzaltenango(Xela), Guatemala. For four weeks we went to class every weekday from nine in the morning to two in the afternoon and there was homework as well. We progressed greatly in that month and when we continued traveling it was even more fun than before as we could actually have some proper conversations with people. Going to school for a month also re-learned me how to learn and I notice how benificial that is in everything I do.

## A new location




In the weeks before our flight back to Amsterdam, we realised we weren't really looking forward to go back to Amsterdam. Don't get me wrong, Amsterdam is *the shit* to live in, but I've lived there my entire life and while we were in the flow of doing crazy things, a move to Lisbon didn't seem like a bad idea.

This wasn't entirely on a whim though. We've been thinking about the possibility ever since we started visiting a good friend who moved to Lisbon. We fell in love with the city and especially on dark winterdays the topic came up often. After spending all that time in Central America, Lisbon didn't seem so far away anymore and we went for it.

Amsterdam is a beautiful city to live in, but it seemed that both of us wanted to open a new chapter in our lives. Ever since the first time we've been in Lisbon, Portugal, we fell in love with the city. A good friend of us lived there and we talked about the possibility to move there before.

With all the preperations we had done for our trip, like getting rid of as much stuff as possible and wrapping up loose ends in adminstration and such, we had the perfect opportunity to follow through with a move to a new location. Even before we left Bogota for Amsterdam, we booked a flight from Amsterdam to Portugal seven days after our return.

The first two weeks in Portugal we stayed with our friend and his girlfriend. They had a studio appartment so it was basically like a big sleepover, which was great. After those two weeks, my girlfriend found us a great apartment in the center of town. It's actually one of the nicest appartments we've ever lived in, and after 7.5 months on the road it's really nice to have our own space again.

### Studying and improving

After settling, I picked up some freelance development work. I was surprised that people still knew how to find me because I've barely done any freelancing the past two and a half years. Before traveling I was working for a company and put most of my freelance work aside.

I can't say it has been very busy, but it has been sufficient and it gave me time to study and think about what I want to do next. I've been greatly focussed on enhancing my JavaScript skills and getting a deeper understanding of React. I can honestly say that I found a renewed focus on learning new material.

### And onwards
