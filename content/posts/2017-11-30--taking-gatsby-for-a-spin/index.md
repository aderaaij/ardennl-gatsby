## Summary

GatsbyJS is a static site generator based on React. At the moment of writing, it's the *nouveau riche* on the estate, and if the name is anything to go by, we can expect some exciting new decadence from this development tool. 

## Introduction
Ever since I started following the Gatsby Twitter account I've been wanting in on the action. The daily retweets of developers stating that Gatsby is the most exciting thing since they discovered the `marquee` tag totally convinced me, even though I had no idea if generating a static site based on React is something that makes sense.

It turns out that it does make sense when it's done right. Leveraging React for

So what is Gatsby? Gatsby is a static site generator based on React. If you're in the camp 
that feels that front-end development is over-complicated as it is, it's probably not for you. 
But if you love tooling and experimenting with the latest technique, you'll have a blast with Gatsby! 

## Why I chose Gatsby

Gatsby creates static HTML sites, which is not that special. I even have my own
static site generator / rapid prototype tool: 
[TotallyStatical](https://github.com/aderaaij/totallystatical) which I absolutely
love to use and improve on, so you'd naturally that was my go-to when I started
thinking about making myself a new site. But as Gatsby is based on React and I saw
all kinds of integrated goodness coming by like SVG trace image preloading, I 
really felt that Gatsby deserved a fair chance.
